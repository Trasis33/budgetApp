## Implementation Timeline

Total estimated time: **19-23 days** (3.5-4.5 weeks)

### Detailed Timeline:
- **Week 1**: Steps 1-2 (Hybrid Navigation + Budget/Analytics merge)
- **Week 2**: Steps 3-4 (Recurring Integration + Dashboard Enhancement)
- **Week 3**: Step 5 (Workflow Optimization)
- **Week 4**: Step 6 + Testing & Refinement (Mobile Optimization + final testing)

## Getting Started

1. Start with **Step 1** (Hybrid Navigation) as it provides the foundation
2. Complete each step in order as they build upon each other
3. Test thoroughly after each step before moving to the next
4. Keep backup branches for rollback if needed

Each step includes:
- Detailed technical specifications
- Code examples and file modifications
- Testing checklist
- Rollback procedures
- Success criteria
