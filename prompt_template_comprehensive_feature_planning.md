- Integration Requirements: [INTEGRATION_NEEDS]

Please provide:

1. **Update project documentation** ([PROJECT_DOCS_FILE]) to reflect:
   - Current status with completed features marked as âœ…
   - New features as current phase with ðŸ”„ status indicators
   - Updated priority sections and timelines

2. **Create two comprehensive planning documents:**
   - High-level feature overview markdown file
   - Detailed technical implementation plan (30-50 pages)

**For the implementation plan, include:**
- Executive Summary with current state analysis
- Feature breakdown with technical specifications
- Database schema changes with SQL
- API endpoints with code examples
- Frontend components with React/[FRONTEND_TECH] code
- Integration strategies with existing codebase
- Implementation timeline (phase-by-phase)
- Database migration strategy
- Testing approach (unit, integration, user acceptance)
- Performance considerations
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Future enhancement roadmap

**Technical Requirements:**
- Provide actual code examples for key components
- Include database schema with proper relationships
- Show API endpoint implementations
- Demonstrate frontend component structure
- Include error handling and edge cases
- Consider mobile responsiveness and UX
- Plan for scalability and performance

**Documentation Style:**
- Use clear section headers and numbering
- Include code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Add implementation timelines with day-by-day breakdown
- Provide realistic effort estimates
- Include success metrics and testing strategies
- Use emojis for visual organization (âœ…, ðŸ”„, ðŸ“Š, etc.)
- Create actionable next steps

The output should be production-ready planning documentation that a development team can immediately use to implement the features.
```

- `[INTEGRATION_NEEDS]`: "Chart.js integration and existing data APIs"

### **For User Management Features:**
Replace with:
- `[FEATURE_NAME]`: "Advanced User Authentication"
- `[FEATURE_OBJECTIVE]`: "enhance security and user experience with modern auth flows"
- `[FEATURE_1_NAME]`: "OAuth Integration"
- `[INTEGRATION_NEEDS]`: "Third-party auth providers and existing user database"

### **For E-commerce Features:**
Replace with:
- `[FEATURE_NAME]`: "Shopping Cart & Checkout"
- `[FEATURE_OBJECTIVE]`: "enable users to purchase products with a seamless checkout experience"
- `[FEATURE_1_NAME]`: "Product Cart Management"
- `[INTEGRATION_NEEDS]`: "Payment gateway APIs and inventory management"
