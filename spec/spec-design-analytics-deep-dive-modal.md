# Project

This document contains a detailed prompt for an AI agent to redesign and implement a new UI/UX for the `AnalyticsDeepDiveModal.js` component.

# Objective

Your mission is to transform the existing `AnalyticsDeepDiveModal` from a basic data display into a modern, inviting, and interactive analytics experience. You will completely reimplement the component located at `client/src/components/dashboard/modals/AnalyticsDeepDiveModal.js`, adhering to the design principles outlined in `@docs/design_spec_financial_checkup_ui.md`.

The final output must be a visually rich and insightful tool for exploration, not just a report.

# Core Mandate: A Shift in Purpose

The most critical requirement is to differentiate this modal's purpose from the `BudgetOptimizationTips.js` component.

-   **`BudgetOptimizationTips` is PRESCRIPTIVE (a coach)**: It analyzes data and provides concrete, actionable "tips," "wins," and "opportunities." It tells the user what they *should do*.
-   **`AnalyticsDeepDiveModal` must be DESCRIPTIVE and EXPLORATORY (a magnifying glass)**: It should present a clear, comprehensive, and interactive view of the user's financial data, empowering them to explore trends, compare periods, and draw their own conclusions. It shows the user *what happened* in detail.

**DO NOT** include prescriptive advice, recommendations, or "opportunities" in this modal. The tone must be neutral, data-focused, and empowering.

# Design & UX Vision: "The Financial Check-up" Look and Feel

The new design must be a direct reflection of the principles in `@docs/design_spec_financial_checkup_ui.md`.

### Overall Vibe

-   **Conversational & Supportive**: The UI should feel approachable. Use clear headings and brief, helpful descriptions for each section.
-   **Data-Rich, Never Overwhelming**: Data should be presented in clean, well-spaced "cards" or "widgets." Use soft gradients, rounded corners, and gentle shadows to create a calming, confident aesthetic.
-   **Interactive & Exploratory**: The user should be encouraged to interact with the data. This will be achieved through a new tabbed interface.

### Technology Shift: Recharts Migration
This redesign will fully embrace the project's migration to **Recharts**. All `react-chartjs-2` components will be removed and replaced with their `Recharts` counterparts, styled to match the new design.

### Layout Transformation

Abandon the current single-column layout. Implement a **tab-based interface** to organize the different analytical views. This creates a more structured and less overwhelming experience.

-   **Modal Container**: The overall modal will be larger, using more screen real estate (e.g., `max-w-6xl`, `h-[95vh]`). It should have the signature large corner radius (`rounded-3xl`) and soft shadow.
-   **Header**: Redesign the header to be more prominent. Include a clear title like "Your Financial Story" or "Spending Deep Dive," an icon, and the time-range selector.
-   **Tabs**: Use `shadcn/ui`'s `Tabs` component. Create the following tabs:
    1.  **Overview**: A dashboard of key visualizations and metrics.
    2.  **Trends**: A detailed view of spending composition over time.
    3.  **Breakdown**: A view of contributions and raw numbers.
    4.  **Cash Flow**: A dedicated comparison of income vs. expenses.

### Color, Typography, & Iconography

-   **Color**: Strictly adhere to the `Accent Palette System` from the design spec. Use the `slate` theme as a base and introduce accent colors (`sky`, `emerald`, `indigo`) for charts and KPI cards to add life and visual distinction.
-   **Typography**: Use the specified font sizes and weights from the design spec (e.g., large, semi-bold headlines; smaller, regular body copy).
-   **Icons**: Use `lucide-react` icons throughout the modal to provide visual cues (e.g., in tab headers, KPI cards, and section titles).

# Functional Requirements & Component Breakdown

You will replace the body of the existing component with this new tabbed structure.

### 1. Header

-   **Title**: "Spending Deep Dive" or similar.
-   **Scope & Time Range Display**: Keep the display for the current scope (e.g., "Shared View") and the selected time range. Style it as a "pill" or "badge."
-   **Time Range Selector**: Keep the dropdown but style it to match the new design (e.g., `shadcn/ui` `Select` component).
-   **Close Button**: Style the `X` button as specified in the design doc.

### 2. Tabs Navigation

-   Implement `Tabs` from `shadcn/ui` with the four specified tabs.

### 3. "Overview" Tab Content

This tab is for at-a-glance insights. Create a grid of cards.

-   **Savings Rate Over Time (Line & Bar Combo Chart)**: A primary chart showing the calculated savings rate as a line graph, with the absolute amount saved each month as bars in the background.
-   **Top 5 Spending Categories (Treemap)**: A `Recharts` **Treemap** visualizing the top 5 spending categories for the period. This provides an instant view of the biggest budget items.
-   **KPI Cards**: A row of smaller cards for key stats: Total Spending, Total Income, Net Surplus/Deficit, and Average Monthly Spending.

### 4. "Trends" Tab Content

This tab is for the main time-series visualization.

-   **Category Spending Trends (Stacked Area Chart)**: Replace the old `SpendingTrendsChart`. This new chart will show the composition of spending over time. Each colored area will represent a major spending category, stacked to show the total. This answers, "How is our spending mix changing?"

### 5. "Breakdown" Tab Content

This tab provides contribution insights and raw numbers.

-   **Shared vs. Personal Contribution (100% Stacked Bar Chart)**: A new chart showing the spending for each month, with bars segmented by scope ("Mine," "Partner," "Shared"). This highlights the proportion of contribution from each scope.
-   **Data Table**: A restyled `Table` (using `shadcn/ui`) showing the raw monthly numbers for a detailed review.

### 6. "Cash Flow" Tab Content

This tab focuses on income vs. expenses.

-   **Monthly Cash Flow Chart (Bar Chart)**: A `Recharts` `BarChart` showing two bars for each month: one for total income (e.g., `emerald`) and one for total expenses (e.g., `rose`). This gives a clear, month-by-month comparison of cash flow.

# API & Data Contract Modifications

To power these new visualizations, a new API endpoint is required. The existing `/analytics/trends` endpoint should be preserved for backward compatibility.

-   **New Endpoint**: **`GET /analytics/trends/detailed`**
-   **Description**: This endpoint will provide a richer data structure, including breakdowns by category and scope, which are necessary for the new charts.
-   **Example JSON Response Structure**:
    ```json
    // GET /analytics/trends/detailed/{startDate}/{endDate}?scope=ours
    {
      "timeRange": { "start": "2025-07-01", "end": "2025-09-30" },
      "monthlyData": [
        {
          "month": "2025-07",
          "income": 5000,
          "spending": 4200,
          "savingsRate": 0.16,
          "categories": [
            { "name": "Groceries", "total": 1200, "scope": { "ours": 1000, "mine": 100, "partner": 100 } },
            { "name": "Housing", "total": 2500, "scope": { "ours": 2500, "mine": 0, "partner": 0 } },
            { "name": "Entertainment", "total": 500, "scope": { "ours": 200, "mine": 150, "partner": 150 } }
          ]
        }
        // ... data for other months
      ],
      "periodSummary": {
        "totalIncome": 15000,
        "totalSpending": 12600,
        "netSurplus": 2400,
        "avgMonthlySpending": 4200,
        "topCategories": [
          { "name": "Housing", "total": 7500 },
          { "name": "Groceries", "total": 3600 },
          { "name": "Entertainment", "total": 1500 }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

# Implementation Details

-   **Target File**: `/Users/fredriklanga/Documents/projects2024/budgetApp/client/src/components/dashboard/modals/AnalyticsDeepDiveModal.js`.
-   **Data Fetching**: Update the `fetchData` function to call the new `/analytics/trends/detailed` endpoint.
-   **Component Library**: Heavily utilize `shadcn/ui` components (`Card`, `Tabs`, `Table`, `Select`) and `Recharts` for all charts.
-   **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS classes exclusively.
-   **Utilities**: Continue to use `formatCurrency` for all monetary values.

# What to Avoid (Crucial Constraints)

To prevent functional overlap with `BudgetOptimizationTips.js`, you **MUST NOT** implement the following:

-   **No Prescriptive Language**: Do not use phrases like "You should...", "Consider...", "Here's an opportunity...".
-   **No "Tips" or "Recommendations"**: The UI should not generate or display any form of advice.
-   **No "Confidence Scores" or "Impact Amounts"**: These concepts are specific to the optimization engine.
-   **No "Wins" Section**: Do not call out positive achievements in a separate section. The data should speak for itself.
-   **No Goal-Related Content**: Do not integrate or reference savings goals.

# Final Deliverable

The final output should be the fully reimplemented `AnalyticsDeepDiveModal.js` file. The new code should replace the old code entirely, resulting in a beautiful, functional, and exploratory analytics modal that strictly adheres to this prompt and the referenced design specification.
