# Introduction

This specification outlines the design, functionality, and technical requirements for the Budget page of the application. The Budget page serves as the central hub for users to manage their finances, providing a comprehensive overview of their budget, income, and spending patterns.

## 1. Purpose & Scope

**Purpose**: To provide users with a clear, interactive, and comprehensive interface for tracking their financial health. The page consolidates budget management, income tracking, and financial analytics into a single, cohesive view.

**Scope**: This specification covers the frontend implementation of the Budget page, including its structure, components, data interactions, and user experience. It details three primary sections: Budget Overview, Analytics, and Income Management.

**Audience**: Frontend developers, UI/UX designers, and QA engineers.

## 2. Definitions

- **Budget Overview**: The main dashboard view showing charts for category spending, income vs. expenses, and budget vs. actual spending. It also includes components for managing budgets and income.
- **Analytics**: A section for deeper financial analysis, including optimization tips based on spending habits.
- **Income Management**: A dedicated section to add and view income for the selected month.
- **Lazy Loading**: A performance optimization technique to defer loading of non-critical resources (e.g., charts) until they are needed.
- **API**: Application Programming Interface. The backend service that provides data to the frontend.

## 3. Requirements, Constraints & Guidelines

### Functional Requirements
- **REQ-001**: The page must feature a tabbed interface to switch between 'Budget Overview', 'Analytics', and 'Income Management' sections.
- **REQ-002**: A month/year navigator must be present, allowing users to select the period for which data is displayed. Changing the period must trigger a data refresh.
- **REQ-003**: The 'Budget Overview' tab must display:
    - An enhanced category spending chart (donut chart).
    - An income vs. expense chart (bar chart).
    - A budget vs. actual spending chart (bar chart).
    - A section to manage budgets for each category using an accordion interface.
    - A form to add new income with fields for source, amount, and date.
    - A list of incomes for the selected month, with an option to delete each entry.
- **REQ-004**: The 'Analytics' tab must provide:
    - A time period selector for analytics data (e.g., Last 3/6/12 months).
    - Actionable budget optimization tips.
    - A mechanism to focus and highlight the corresponding budget input field when an optimization tip is acted upon.
- **REQ-005**: The 'Income Management' tab must contain a consolidated view for adding and listing income for the selected month.
- **REQ-006**: All monetary values must be formatted according to the application's currency standards.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **PER-001**: Charts must be lazy-loaded to improve initial page load performance.
- **PER-002**: The UI must display skeleton loaders while data is being fetched to indicate activity.
- **ERR-001**: The page must gracefully handle API errors by displaying a user-friendly error message and a 'Retry' button.

### Constraints
- **CON-001**: The component is dependent on several child components, including `MonthYearNavigator`, various chart components, and UI elements from the design system.
- **CON-002**: All data is fetched from the application's backend API via a pre-configured `axios` instance.
- **CON-003**: User authentication is managed through the `useAuth` context. The page should not render for unauthenticated users.

### Guidelines
- **GUD-001**: Chart colors should be consistent and adhere to the predefined color palette in `chartColors`.
- **GUD-002**: UI interactions should provide clear visual feedback (e.g., highlighting, focus states).

## 4. Interfaces & Data Contracts

The Budget page interacts with the following API endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint                               | Description                                       |
|--------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `GET`  | `/incomes?month={MM}&year={YYYY}`      | Fetches all incomes for the specified month/year. |
| `POST` | `/incomes`                             | Adds a new income entry.                          |
| `DELETE`| `/incomes/:id`                        | Deletes a specific income entry.                  |
| `GET`  | `/summary/charts/{YYYY}/{MM}`          | Fetches aggregated data for charts.               |
| `GET`  | `/categories`                          | Fetches all available expense categories.         |
| `POST` | `/budgets`                             | Creates or updates a budget for a category.       |

### Data Schemas

**Chart Data (`/summary/charts/{YYYY}/{MM}`)**
```json
{
  "categorySpending": [
    {
      "category": "Groceries",
      "total": 500.00,
      "budget": 600.00
    }
  ],
  "monthlyTotals": {
    "income": 5000.00,
    "expenses": 3200.00
  }
}
```

**Income (`/incomes`)**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "source": "Salary",
  "amount": 5000.00,
  "date": "2025-10-01"
}
```

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-001**: **Given** a user is logged in and navigates to the Budget page, **When** the page loads, **Then** the 'Budget Overview' tab is active and displays data for the current month and year.
- **AC-002**: **Given** the user is on the Budget page, **When** they select a different month or year, **Then** the data for all sections (charts, income list, etc.) updates to reflect the new period.
- **AC-003**: **Given** the user is on the 'Budget Overview' tab, **When** they enter a value in a budget input and the component saves, **Then** the new budget value is persisted and reflected in the 'Budget vs. Actual' chart.
- **AC-004**: **Given** the user is on the 'Analytics' tab, **When** they click a button on an optimization tip to adjust a budget, **Then** they are scrolled to the 'Manage Budgets' section, and the relevant category input is focused and highlighted.
- **AC-005**: **Given** an API call fails, **When** the page attempts to load data, **Then** an error card with a 'Retry' button is displayed.

## 6. Test Automation Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Use Jest and React Testing Library to test individual components and hooks. Mock API calls using `axios-mock-adapter`.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between components, such as the month navigator updating the charts.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Use a framework like Cypress to simulate user flows, such as adding an income and verifying it appears in the list and updates the charts.
- **Coverage Requirements**: Aim for a minimum of 80% code coverage for new and modified components.

## 7. Rationale & Context

The design consolidates related financial tasks into a single page to provide a seamless user experience. The tabbed layout organizes complex information without overwhelming the user. Lazy loading and skeleton screens are employed to optimize perceived performance, which is critical for a data-heavy dashboard. The interactive nature of the analytics and budget management sections is intended to empower users to make informed financial decisions.

## 8. Dependencies & External Integrations

### External Systems
- **EXT-001**: Backend API - Provides all financial data for the application.

### Technology Platform Dependencies
- **PLT-001**: React `v17+` - Core frontend library.
- **PLT-002**: `axios` - For making HTTP requests to the backend.
- **PLT-003**: `chart.js` / `react-chartjs-2` - For rendering charts.
- **PLT-004**: `shadcn/ui` - For core UI components like Tabs and Accordion.

## 9. Examples & Edge Cases

**Edge Case: No Data**
If the API returns no data for a given month (e.g., no expenses or income), the charts and lists should display a "No data available" message or an empty state, rather than crashing.

```javascript
// Example of handling no chart data
const getCategoryChartData = () => {
  if (!chartData?.categorySpending || chartData.categorySpending.length === 0) {
    return null; // Or return a default structure for an empty chart
  }
  // ... proceed with data mapping
};
```

**Edge Case: Highlighting a budget input**
The `handleFocusBudgetInput` function handles scrolling to and highlighting a budget input. It includes a timeout to remove the highlight and uses `requestAnimationFrame` to ensure the focus action is not blocked.

## 10. Validation Criteria

- All functional and non-functional requirements listed in Section 3 are met.
- All acceptance criteria in Section 5 pass.
- The implementation passes all automated tests (Unit, Integration) with the required code coverage.
- The page is responsive and displays correctly on common screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
