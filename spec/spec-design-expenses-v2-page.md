# 1. High-Level Vision & Goal

This document provides a detailed design and implementation prompt to completely redesign the `client/src/pages/ExpensesV2.js` component.

**The Goal:** Transform the current, data-dense, table-based expenses page into a modern, inviting, and insightful "Spending Hub." The new design must strictly adhere to the principles, components, and visual language defined in the **`docs/design_spec_financial_checkup_ui.md`**.

The user experience should shift from one of manual data auditing to receiving guided, conversational insights about their spending. The page should feel less like a spreadsheet and more like a helpful financial coach, proactively highlighting what matters most.

# 2. Core Mandate: Adopt the "Financial Check-up" Philosophy

The entire redesign must be filtered through the lens of the Financial Check-up design spec. Key principles to embody are:

- **Conversational & Supportive:** Use friendly, encouraging language. Frame insights positively.
- **Data-Rich, Never Overwhelming:** Replace raw data tables with visualizations and summaries.
- **Action-Oriented:** Every piece of information should have a clear next step.
- **Calming Confidence:** Employ the specified layout, typography, and color palette to create a welcoming and stress-free environment.

**Technology Shift:** This redesign will deprecate the use of `flowbite-react` and the associated `expenses-v2.css` file. The new implementation **must** be built using the project's existing modern component architecture. This involves creating new, custom components that leverage `radix-ui` primitives, `class-variance-authority` for variants, and `tailwind-merge` for styling, fully aligning with the aesthetic of the design spec.

# 3. Proposed Layout & Component Redesign

We will move from the current two-column layout to a more fluid, single-feed layout composed of cards, inspired by the design spec's grid system.

### 3.1. Page Header & Filters

- **Current:** A simple toolbar with `<Select>` dropdowns.
- **New Vision:** A `Section Banner` component.
    - **Content:** It should display a welcoming, dynamic title like `"Here's your spending for October 2025"` or `"A look at your year so far"`, depending on the filter selection.
    - **Actions:** The primary "Add Expense" button (from the main app layout, but consider its context here) and a redesigned filter control should be integrated.
    - **Filters:** Replace the row of dropdowns with a single `Button` with a "Filter" icon (`lucide-react`). Clicking this button should open a `Popover` or `Sheet` containing the Month, Year, and Category select controls. This cleans up the primary view. Include a "Reset" button within this popover.

### 3.2. KPI Cards to Insight Cards

- **Current:** Four simple KPI cards with a label and a number.
- **New Vision:** Reimagine these as `Card` components from the design spec. Each card should tell a story.
    - **Total Spending Card:**
        - **Title:** "October Spending" (dynamic).
        - **Body:** A sentence of context, e.g., "This is what you and your partner have spent so far."
        - **Visualization:** A small `Recharts` line or bar chart showing spending trend over the last few days or weeks.
        - **Impact Chip:** Show the total amount, e.g., `formatCurrency(scopedTotal)`.
        - **Actions:** A "View All Transactions" action pill.
    - **Recurring Costs Card:**
        - **Title:** "Upcoming Bills"
        - **Body:** "You have X recurring bills scheduled for this month."
        - **Visualization:** A donut chart or progress bar showing how many have been paid vs. are upcoming.
        - **Actions:** The "Generate for month" button should be styled as a primary action pill here if bills for the selected period haven't been generated. If they have, this could change to "Review Recurring".

### 3.3. Replacing the Main Expense Table

- **Current:** A large, monolithic `<table>` that dominates the UI.
- **New Vision:** Replace the table's primary position with a more intelligent, grouped list of transactions. The full, unfiltered table is a power-user feature and should be de-emphasized.
    - **Group by Category:** The default view should group the `filteredExpenses` by category.
    - **Category Summary Cards:** For each category with spending, display a `Card`.
        - **Layout:** Use the two-column grid from the design spec for these cards.
        - **Card Content:**
            - **Header:** Category Name and an icon.
            - **Body:** A summary sentence, e.g., "You've spent `formatCurrency(total)` on Groceries across 5 transactions."
            - **Visualization:** A mini-chart showing this category's spending trend vs. last month.
            - **Actions:** An "Expand" or "View Transactions" button/pill. Clicking this could either expand the card to show the transaction list inline or open a `Sheet` from the side with the transaction details for that category.

### 3.4. Right Rail to Actionable Insights

- **Current:** An accordion for "Recurring Templates" and a static "Quick Insights" list.
- **New Vision:** These become dynamic, actionable `Card` components integrated into the main card grid.
    - **"Quick Insights" Card:**
        - This is the perfect candidate for the "Financial Check-up" concept.
        - **Title:** "Your Financial Check-up"
        - **Body:** Dynamically generate insights based on the data. Examples:
            - "Your spending on `Transport` is trending up by 15% this month." (Use an "Alert" color from the palette).
            - "You've saved `amount` on `Groceries` compared to last month. Great job!" (Use a "Win" color).
            - "We detected a new recurring charge from `Vendor`."
        - **Visualization:** Each insight should have a corresponding mini-chart.
        - **Actions:** "See Transactions", "Adjust Budget", etc.

# 4. Implementation Details & Requirements

- **File:** `client/src/pages/ExpensesV2.js`.
- **Styling:** 
    - Remove the import for `../styles/expenses-v2.css` and delete the file. 
    - All styling must be implemented via Tailwind CSS utilities, leveraging `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` as needed.
- **Component Architecture:**
    - **DEPRECATE:** Remove all `flowbite-react` imports (`Select`, `Accordion`, etc.). Do not use Flowbite for any new UI elements.
    - **CONSTRUCT:** Build new, custom components for this page (e.g., `Card`, `Button`, `Select`, `Popover`) that are visually and functionally aligned with the design spec.
    - **FOUNDATION:** Use the existing libraries in the project as the foundation for these new components, also look at implementation details of client/src/pages/Budget.js:
        - **`class-variance-authority`** to create styled variants (e.g., button styles).
        - **`lucide-react`** for all icons.
        - **`recharts`** for all data visualizations.
- **Data Flow:** The existing data fetching logic (`useScopedExpenses`, `useEffect` hooks) can be retained, but the rendering logic must be completely replaced to build the new UI.
- **State Management:** Continue to use the existing hooks and contexts (`useScope`, `useExpenseModal`).
- **Accessibility:** Ensure all new components built on Radix primitives are fully accessible, following the guidelines in the design spec (e.g., `aria-label` for icon buttons).

# 5. Final Deliverable

A completely rewritten `client/src/pages/ExpensesV2.js` file that implements the new "Spending Hub" design according to the specifications above. The resulting UI should be clean, modern, and insightful, achieved by building custom components using the project's established modern stack (Radix, CVA, Tailwind CSS).
