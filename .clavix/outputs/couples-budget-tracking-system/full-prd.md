# Product Requirements Document: Couples Budget Tracking System

## Problem & Goal
Couples struggle to track shared expenses, split costs fairly, and see their monthly financial patterns. 
The goal is to build an intuitive web app where couples can log expenses, set budgets, and get insights into their spending habits together.

## Requirements
### Must-Have Features
1. **User accounts for both partners with shared profile**: Enable two users to create linked accounts that share financial data while maintaining individual identities
2. **Expense logging with category selection and automatic cost splitting**: Allow either partner to log expenses and automatically calculate fair splits (50/50, custom ratios, or one person pays)
3. **Monthly budget setting and tracking by category**: Enable couples to set spending limits per category (groceries, entertainment, utilities) and track progress against these budgets
4. **Simple dashboard showing current spending vs budget**: Provide an overview displaying total spending this month, remaining budget by category, and key financial metrics
5. **Settlement calculator showing who owes whom money**: Calculate and display net balances between partners, showing who should pay whom and how much

### Technical Requirements
Built upon existing infrastructure using React/TypeScript frontend with Express/SQLite backend. Must be accessible, mobile-responsive, and intuitive for couples who might not be tech-savvy.

## Out of Scope
- Investment portfolio tracking
- Bank integration
- Tax calculation
- Mobile native app

## Additional Context
Focus on user experience and accessibility. The web app should be mobile-responsive and intuitive for couples who might not be tech-savvy. No specific deadlines. Security considerations for financial data handling.
