# Couples Budget Tracking System - Quick PRD

Couples struggle to track shared expenses, split costs fairly, and see their monthly financial patterns. Build an intuitive web app where couples can log expenses, set budgets, and get insights into their spending habits together. The system must include user accounts for both partners with shared profiles, expense logging with category selection and automatic cost splitting, monthly budget setting and tracking by category, a simple dashboard showing current spending vs budget, and a settlement calculator showing who owes whom money.

The technical implementation should build upon existing infrastructure using React/TypeScript frontend with Express/SQLite backend. The web app must be accessible, mobile-responsive, and intuitive for couples who might not be tech-savvy, with proper security considerations for financial data handling.

Out of scope: investment portfolio tracking, bank integration, tax calculation, and mobile native apps. Focus should remain on core expense tracking, budgeting, and fair cost splitting functionality between partners.
