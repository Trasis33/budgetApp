# Introduction

![Status: Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Planned-blue)

Complete redesign of the expenses page to follow the new Hybrid B mockup design which features a table-first approach with collapsible category boards. This implementation will create a fresh new component rather than modifying the existing one, allowing for a clean implementation that matches the mockup design exactly while preserving all existing backend functionality.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

### Functional Requirements
- **REQ-001**: Complete visual redesign following Hybrid B mockup layout exactly
- **REQ-002**: Preserve all existing backend functionality from current Expenses.js
- **REQ-003**: Implement table-first layout with sticky header
- **REQ-004**: Create collapsible category boards section (collapsed by default)
- **REQ-005**: Add summary metric cards in header
- **REQ-006**: Dense toolbar with month/year/category filters
- **REQ-007**: Right sidebar with recurring templates and quick insights
- **REQ-008**: Export CSV functionality for filtered data
- **REQ-009**: Delete confirmation with optimistic UI updates
- **REQ-010**: Generate recurring bills functionality

### Design Requirements
- **DES-001**: Use Flowbite React components for consistent UI
- **DES-002**: Follow DM Sans typography from mockup
- **DES-003**: Implement exact color scheme from mockup (#10b981 primary, neutral grays)
- **DES-004**: Card-based layout with proper spacing and shadows
- **DES-005**: Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
- **DES-006**: Hover effects and interactive states

### Technical Constraints
- **CON-001**: Must work with existing backend API endpoints
- **CON-002**: Use existing design system CSS variables where possible
- **CON-003**: Maintain accessibility standards (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- **CON-004**: Performance: handle large expense lists efficiently
- **CON-005**: Create new component file, don't modify existing Expenses.js

### Security & Guidelines
- **SEC-001**: Delete actions require explicit user confirmation
- **GUD-001**: Follow React best practices with hooks and state management
- **GUD-002**: Use TypeScript-like patterns for better code quality
- **GUD-003**: Implement proper error handling and loading states

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Modify existing Expenses.js component - Rejected due to complexity of preserving existing functionality while completely changing layout
- **ALT-002**: Use different UI library (Material-UI, Ant Design) - Rejected as project already uses Flowbite/Tailwind ecosystem
- **ALT-003**: Implement as multiple smaller components - Considered but single component approach chosen for simpler state management
- **ALT-004**: Server-side filtering - Rejected as current implementation uses client-side filtering successfully

## 4. Dependencies

### External Libraries
- **DEP-001**: Flowbite React components (Table, Card, Button, Badge, Select)
- **DEP-002**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo, useCallback)
- **DEP-003**: Existing utility functions (formatCurrency)
- **DEP-004**: Axios for HTTP requests
- **DEP-005**: React Router for navigation

### Internal Dependencies
- **DEP-006**: Existing API endpoints (/expenses, /categories, /recurring-expenses, /summary/monthly)
- **DEP-007**: Current design system CSS variables
- **DEP-008**: Existing components (MonthYearNavigator if reused)

## 5. Files

### New Files to Create
- **FILE-001**: `/client/src/pages/ExpensesV2.js` - Main new expenses page component
- **FILE-002**: `/client/src/styles/expenses-v2.css` - Custom styles for new design
- **FILE-003**: `/client/src/components/ui/CategoryBoard.js` - Individual category board component (if extracted)

### Files to Reference/Import From
- **FILE-004**: `/client/src/pages/Expenses.js` - Current implementation for functionality reference
- **FILE-005**: `/client/src/styles/design-system.css` - Existing design system
- **FILE-006**: `/client/src/utils/` - Utility functions like formatCurrency
- **FILE-007**: `/client/src/components/MonthYearNavigator.js` - Date navigation component

## 6. Testing

### Unit Tests
- **TEST-001**: Component renders without crashing with mock data
- **TEST-002**: Filtering functionality works correctly for month/year/category
- **TEST-003**: CSV export generates correct format with filtered data
- **TEST-004**: Delete functionality triggers confirmation and API call
- **TEST-005**: Category boards expand/collapse correctly
- **TEST-006**: Summary calculations are accurate

### Integration Tests
- **TEST-007**: API calls are made with correct parameters
- **TEST-008**: Error states are displayed properly
- **TEST-009**: Loading states show during data fetch
- **TEST-010**: Navigation to add/edit pages works correctly

### Visual/E2E Tests
- **TEST-011**: Layout matches mockup design pixel-perfectly
- **TEST-012**: Responsive behavior works across breakpoints
- **TEST-013**: Interactive elements have proper hover/focus states
- **TEST-014**: Accessibility requirements are met (axe-core tests)

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

### Technical Risks
- **RISK-001**: Backend API changes might break integration - Low probability, APIs are stable
- **RISK-002**: Performance issues with large expense lists - Mitigated by existing pagination/filtering
- **RISK-003**: Flowbite components might not support all required customization - Medium risk, fallback to custom components

### Design Risks
- **RISK-004**: Mockup design might not be responsive-friendly - Addressed by mobile-first implementation
- **RISK-005**: User adoption of new layout might be slow - Mitigated by preserving all existing functionality

### Assumptions
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: Current backend API endpoints will remain stable during implementation
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: Existing design system CSS variables are compatible with new design
- **ASSUMPTION-003**: Flowbite React components provide sufficient customization options
- **ASSUMPTION-004**: Users will prefer the new table-first layout over current card-based approach
