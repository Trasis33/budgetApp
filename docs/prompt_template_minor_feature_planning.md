3. [CHANGE_3] - [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]

**Requirements:**
- Implementation Timeline: [1-5_DAYS]
- Priority Level: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
- Scope: [STYLING/REFACTORING/MINOR_FEATURE]

Please provide:

1. **Quick implementation plan (3-5 pages)** including:
   - Current state analysis
   - Step-by-step transformation guide
   - Before/after code examples
   - Testing checklist
   - Implementation timeline (day-by-day)

**For the implementation plan, include:**
- Executive Summary (1 paragraph)
- Component analysis and changes needed
- Code transformation examples with exact replacements
- Implementation steps (numbered list)
- Quality assurance checklist
- Success criteria

**Technical Requirements:**
- Provide specific code examples for key changes
- Include exact class/style replacements
- Show before/after component structure
- Maintain existing functionality
- Preserve responsive behavior
- No performance regression

**Documentation Style:**
- Concise and actionable
- Code blocks with clear annotations
- Simple day-by-day timeline
- Practical success metrics
- Use emojis for quick visual scanning (âœ…, ðŸ”„, ðŸŽ¨, etc.)

The output should be a focused, immediately actionable implementation guide.

2. Standardize prop interfaces across similar components
3. Improve component organization and file structure
```

### **For Minor UI Enhancements:**
```
**Minor Feature Request:**
I want to implement Enhanced Loading States which will improve user experience during data fetching.

**Target Changes:**
1. Add skeleton loading animations
2. Improve error state messaging
3. Add retry functionality for failed requests
```

- Browser Support: [MODERN_BROWSERS/IE11_SUPPORT/etc.]
```

### **For Component Refactoring:**
Add these sections:
```
**Refactoring Context:**
- Code Quality Goals: [MAINTAINABILITY/PERFORMANCE/CONSISTENCY]
- Breaking Changes Allowed: [YES/NO]
- Testing Coverage: [EXISTING_TESTS/NO_TESTS]
- Component Dependencies: [LIST_DEPENDENT_COMPONENTS]
```

### **For Performance Optimization:**
Add these sections:
```
**Performance Context:**
- Current Performance Issues: [SPECIFIC_PROBLEMS]

## **Example Filled Template**

```
I need to create a focused implementation plan for budgetApp.

**Project Context:**
- Project Type: WEB_APP
- Technology Stack: React + Node.js/Express + SQLite
- Current Phase: Design System Integration Phase

**Minor Feature Request:**
I want to implement Design System Integration for Analytics Components which will standardize styling across SpendingPatternsChart, SavingsRateTracker, and DashboardAnalytics components.
