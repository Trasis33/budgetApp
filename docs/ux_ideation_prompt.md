ðŸŽ¯ UX IDEATION PROMPT: Personal Finance App Workflow Optimization

Context:
I'm refining a couples' budget tracking app that currently has 8 separate pages. Users are a couple tracking shared expenses, bill splitting, and budgets. The app handles expense entry, recurring bills, budget management, analytics, and monthly statements.

Current Pain Points:
â€¢  Too much navigation between related features
â€¢  Bill splitting functionality exists in 3 different places
â€¢  Users need multiple clicks to complete common tasks
â€¢  Analytics and budget data are separated despite being related

Core User Behaviors to Optimize:
1. Daily: Add expenses on mobile while shopping/dining
2. Weekly: Quick budget check - "are we on track?"
3. Monthly: Review spending, settle shared expenses, plan next month

Constraints:
â€¢  Mobile-first design (most expense entry happens on phones)
â€¢  Must preserve all current functionality
â€¢  Template-based recurring bills system must stay (it works well)
â€¢  Considering future monetization potential

Design Challenge:
How can I consolidate 8 pages into 5 logical sections while reducing clicks for common tasks and making advanced features discoverable for potential premium tiers?

Specific Questions:
1. Information Architecture: What's the most intuitive way to group: [Expenses + Recurring Bills] and [Budget + Analytics]?
2. Navigation Patterns: For a mobile-first finance app, what works better:
â€¢  Traditional tabs
â€¢  Floating action buttons with contextual menus
â€¢  Swipe-based navigation
â€¢  Bottom navigation with nested sections
3. Progressive Disclosure: How can I show basic info by default but make detailed analytics easily accessible without burying them?
4. Workflow Optimization: What's the optimal click path for:
â€¢  Adding a shared dinner expense and seeing how it affects the monthly budget
â€¢  Checking if recurring bills have been generated this month
â€¢  Viewing who owes whom after adding several expenses
5. Cross-Feature Integration: How can I create seamless connections between:
â€¢  Adding expenses â†’ Immediate budget impact visualization
â€¢  Recurring bill templates â†’ Monthly expense generation
â€¢  Individual expenses â†’ Settlement calculations

Success Metrics:
â€¢  Reduce clicks for common tasks by 40%
â€¢  Increase feature discovery (users finding analytics/reports)
â€¢  Maintain mobile usability while adding desktop productivity features
â€¢  Prepare for premium feature placement

Innovation Opportunities:
â€¢  Smart defaults based on user patterns
â€¢  Contextual suggestions (e.g., "You're 80% through your dining budget")
â€¢  Cross-screen continuity (start on mobile, finish on desktop)
â€¢  Anticipatory UI (pre-load likely next actions)
