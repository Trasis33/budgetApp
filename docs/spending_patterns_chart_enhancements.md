# SpendingPatternsChart Enhancements

## Overview

This document outlines the enhancements made to the SpendingPatternsChart component during its migration to shadcn/ui with Recharts. These enhancements focus on providing more valuable information to users without compromising the existing functionality or clean interface of the original component.

## Enhanced Features

- **Average Spending Reference**: Displays a reference line showing the average spending across the time period, helping users identify months with above or below average spending

### 2. Enhanced Data Insights

#### Month-over-Month Change Percentage

The chart data now includes month-over-month change percentage calculations, allowing users to see:

- How their spending is trending (increasing or decreasing) each month
- The magnitude of spending changes between consecutive months
- Potential seasonal patterns in spending behavior
