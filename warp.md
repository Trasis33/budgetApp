## Key Architecture & Implementation Notes

### **What Was Initially Missed:**
1. The dashboard is **already fully implemented** with monthly summaries and recent expenses
2. All core features are **completely functional** - this is a working MVP
3. The recurring bills system has sophisticated **update handling** and **duplicate prevention**
4. The monthly statement generator includes **print functionality**
5. The bill splitting calculator is **fully operational** with all split types

### **Current State:** 
This is a **complete, functional MVP** that already meets the original Phase 1 goals. The app can be used productively right now for expense tracking and bill splitting.

### **Architecture Overview**
- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS for mobile-first responsive design
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for RESTful API endpoints
- **Database**: SQLite for lightweight, minimal-setup data persistence
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure token storage

### **Key Database Features**
- **Recurring Expenses**: Sophisticated template system with update handling
- **Bill Splitting**: Supports 50/50, custom ratio, and personal expense splitting
- **Monthly Statements**: Automated generation with balance calculations
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Unique constraints prevent data inconsistencies

## Development Workflow

### **Starting the App**
```bash
npm run dev  # Starts both client and server
```

### **Database Management**
- **Schema Changes**: Delete `server/db/expense_tracker.sqlite` to force recreation
- **Debugging**: Check server console for recurring expense generation logs

### **Key Files Structure**
```

└── utils/formatCurrency.js # Currency formatting utility
```

## Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Week 1**: Budget tracking (salary input, remaining budget calculations)
2. **Week 2**: Advanced reporting and category spending analysis  
3. **Week 3**: Data visualizations with Chart.js
4. **Week 4**: Export functionality and UI polish
5. **Week 5**: Security review and deployment preparation
6. **Week 6**: Production deployment

## Success Metrics
- Both users actively using the system daily
- Faster data entry than previous Numbers document
- Accurate monthly settlements without manual calculation
- Zero data loss or corruption
- Mobile-friendly interface that works seamlessly on phones
