2. **Split-First Design**: Every expense entry assumes partner involvement
3. **Transparency by Default**: No hidden expenses unless explicitly personal
4. **Settlement Clarity**: Clear, unambiguous "who owes whom" language
5. **Shared Decision Making**: Important changes require both partners' input

4. **Settlement Automation**: Eliminates manual calculation and "who paid for what" arguments

5. **Collaborative Budget Management**: Both partners must agree on spending limits, fostering communication

6. **Mobile-Optimized for Real Usage**: Quick expense entry while grocery shopping, not desktop-focused analysis

## Conclusion

CouplesFlow represents a return to the original vision: **a purpose-built tool for couples to manage money together transparently and fairly**. By focusing on the unique needs of 2-person households, we can create something much more valuable than generic personal finance software.

The app should feel like **"our money management system"** rather than **"a finance app we both use"**.

**Next Steps**: Begin Phase 1 implementation to restore couples-specific features while preserving the advanced analytics and visualization capabilities that have been built.
