# Couples’ Budgeting App — Horizon Design Concepts

This folder contains three distinct, production-realistic UI mockups for a couples’ budgeting app. Each mockup is mobile-first (iOS/Android), scales to tablet, and aligns to the PRD in [docs/prd.md](docs/prd.md). All concepts are inspired by the provided image’s clarity and card rhythm but avoid glassmorphism and do not replicate components 1:1.

Files:
- mockup-a-dual-ledger.md — “Dual Ledger” (tabbed scopes: Mine • Ours • Partner)
- mockup-b-cards-and-stacks.md — “Cards & Stacks” (card stacks, bottom sheet workflows)
- mockup-c-inbox-to-budget.md — “Inbox-to-Budget” (actions-first, approvals inbox)

Each file includes:
- Name and summary
- IA and navigation
- Key screens with annotations
- Visual system (color, type, icons, components)
- Interaction patterns and motion
- Accessibility
- States (empty, loading, error, success, overspent, under budget, pending)
- Collaboration flows and notifications
- Rationale for couples dynamics and friction reduction

Usage:
- Review each mockup independently.
- Pick one primary direction and one backup.
- Mix patterns deliberately if needed (not ad-hoc).
