# Summary: Budget vs. Actual Spending Comparisons

This document summarizes the work completed on the "Add budget vs. actual spending comparisons" feature, including implemented functionality, resolved issues, and potential areas for further refinement.

## Implemented Functionality

*   **Database:** A new `budgets` table was created using Knex migrations to store monthly budget targets for each category. This table includes `category_id`, `amount`, `month`, `year`, and a unique constraint to prevent duplicate entries.
*   **Backend API:**
    *   A new API endpoint (`POST /api/budgets`) was implemented to allow for the creation and updating of category budgets.
    *   The existing `GET /api/summary/charts/:year/:month` endpoint was updated to fetch and include budget data alongside actual spending for each category.
*   **Frontend (client/src/pages/Budget.js):**
    *   A new "Manage Budgets" section was added, providing a user interface to set and save monthly budgets for each expense category.
    *   A new "Budget vs. Actual Spending" grouped bar chart was integrated, visually comparing budgeted amounts against actual expenditures per category.
    *   The existing "Income vs. Expenses" bar chart was retained as per user request.

## What Worked Well

*   The implementation of Knex migrations for database schema changes was successful, providing a more robust and data-preserving approach than direct database recreation.
*   The backend API endpoints are now correctly fetching and serving the necessary budget and actual spending data.
*   The core functionality of setting and displaying budgets, along with the new comparison chart, is working as intended.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

*   **Backend Query Errors:** Initial `500` server errors were encountered due to incorrect `knex.raw` usage and improper aggregation of `budgets.amount` in the `GET /api/summary/charts` query. These were resolved by correcting the Knex syntax and using `db.raw` and `COALESCE(MAX(budgets.amount), 0)` for the budget column.
*   **Chart Vertical Expansion:** Both the "Income vs. Expenses" and "Budget vs. Actual Spending" bar charts experienced an "infinite" vertical growth issue on hover or window resize. This was fixed by ensuring their container elements have a fixed height (`h-96` Tailwind class) and setting `maintainAspectRatio: false` in the chart options.
*   **Doughnut Chart Legend Overflow:** The legend for the "Spending by Category" doughnut chart was taking up excessive space, especially on smaller screens. This was addressed by moving the legend to the `bottom` of the chart.
*   **"Manage Budgets" Section Overflow:** The input fields and save buttons in the "Manage Budgets" section were overflowing their container on smaller screen sizes. This was mitigated by reducing the width of the input fields (`w-20`) and adding a `truncate` class to the category labels.

## Potential Remaining Frontend Issues

*   **Responsive Design for "Manage Budgets":** While the overflow in the "Manage Budgets" section was addressed, further testing on various screen sizes might reveal more subtle layout challenges. The current fix is a targeted adjustment, and a more comprehensive responsive design strategy for this section might be beneficial in the future.
*   **Chart Label Readability:** Depending on the number of categories and screen size, the labels on the charts (especially the bar chart's X-axis) might become crowded. This could be improved with further Chart.js options for label rotation, font size adjustments, or dynamic label hiding.

This summary should provide a good starting point for continuing development in a future session.
