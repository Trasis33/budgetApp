### **‚ùå Persistent Avatar Visibility Issue:**

**The Problem:**
Despite multiple attempts, the user avatar in the top-right corner remains invisible or improperly displayed. The avatar should show:
- Circular gradient background (purple to cyan)
- User's initial letter (e.g., "F" for Fredrik)
- Proper sizing (32x32px) with subtle border

**What Was Tried:**
1. **Custom CSS Classes**: Created `.navbar-user-avatar` styles (conflicted with existing `.avatar` class)
2. **Tailwind Classes**: Used gradient utilities (`from-primary-400 to-primary-600`) - may not be defined in config
3. **Inline Styles**: Applied direct gradient CSS with design system colors
4. **Removed Conflicts**: Eliminated existing `.avatar` element that had light blue background

**Current State:**
- Avatar container has correct dimensions and positioning
- Inline styles applied: `background: linear-gradient(135deg, #8b5cf6 0%, #06b6d4 100%)`
- Text content (user initial) is present but background appears invisible
- All other navbar elements (title, dropdown, scope selector) work perfectly

### **üîß Recommended Next Steps:**

**For Fresh Chat Investigation:**
1. **Check Tailwind Config**: Verify if `primary-400/600` colors are defined
2. **Inspect CSS Cascade**: Check if other styles are overriding the avatar
3. **Browser DevTools**: Examine computed styles for the avatar element
4. **Alternative Approach**: Consider using a simple background color first, then add gradient
5. **CSS Variables**: Use the existing `--bg-gradient-primary` from design system

**Quick Fix Options:**
- Replace gradient with solid color temporarily to verify visibility
- Use `bg-primary` class if defined in Tailwind config
- Check if `primary` colors are properly configured in `tailwind.config.js`

The navbar redesign itself is complete and functional - only the avatar visualization needs resolution.
